No spaces are needed inbetween the "id" and the data
You may put multiple of the same id
You may also use commas to seperate multiple(Do not use spaces)
Please note that there is a bug that disables the use of "'\\'" although it does not cause errors

For use of the interpreter that formats in to plain text
First you will be prompted if you want to open docs(which you did)
Next you will be prompted to enter the filename of the file. The file does need to be in current dir
enter the full filename ex:( ex.ks )
it will read the file as a variable called fn
next it will convert all "ids/tokens" to the yaml like output script
you can see the original and new file seperated by a line
you will next be prompted to enter filename to create/overwrite
The file can have any file extention but .DX .YAML .TXT are prefered
